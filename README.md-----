# Domain Checker

This project is a simple domain name checker that allows users to input a domain name and check its registration status. The application is structured into a frontend and a backend, with the frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the backend developed in Python using Flask.

## Project Structure

```
domain-checker
├── frontend
│   ├── index.html       # HTML structure for the front-end interface
│   ├── styles.css       # CSS styles for the front-end interface
│   └── script.js        # JavaScript code for handling user interactions
├── backend
│   ├── app.py           # Main entry point for the Python backend
│   └── requirements.txt  # Python dependencies for the backend
└── README.md            # Documentation for the project
```

## Frontend

The frontend consists of an HTML page where users can enter a domain name. It includes:

- An input field for the domain name.
- A button to submit the query.
- A section to display the results of the domain check.

### Files

- `frontend/index.html`: Contains the structure of the user interface.
- `frontend/styles.css`: Contains styles for the user interface.
- `frontend/script.js`: Contains JavaScript for handling user input and displaying results.

## Backend

The backend is responsible for processing the domain name input, validating it, and querying the WHOIS API to check the registration status. It is built using Flask.

### Files

- `backend/app.py`: Sets up the web server, handles incoming requests, validates domain names, and queries the WHOIS API.
- `backend/requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages, such as Flask and requests.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd domain-checker
   ```

2. **Set up the backend:**
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
   - Install the required Python packages:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Run the backend server:
     ```
     python app.py
     ```

3. **Set up the frontend:**
   - Open `frontend/index.html` in a web browser to access the application.

## Usage

1. Enter a domain name in the input field.
2. Click the "Check Domain" button.
3. The application will display whether the domain is registered or not, along with additional information such as registration date and WHOIS data.
